### About ###
This is a Rust port of the code from Terence Parr's ["The Definitive ANTLR 4 Reference"](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpantlr2/the-definitive-antlr-4-reference/).

the-definitive-antlr4-reference-rs is an EDLA project.

The purpose of [edla.org](http://www.edla.org) is to promote the state of the art in various domains.

### Usage ###
The code use [antlr-rust 0.3.0-beta](https://crates.io/crates/antlr_rust/0.3.0-beta).

### Issues with antlr4rust (all very minor so far) ###
- starter
    - ArrayInitListener in translate.rs show no value in enter_value, exit_value has been used instead.
- tour
    - generation with -no-listener -visitor leave LabeledExprListener usage in labeledexprparser.rs and lead to compilation error. Use only -visitor fix it.
    - Java.g4 give a bunch of "symbol type conflicts with generated code in target language or runtime" errors.
    - Embededed code inside grammar is not portable. This is not an antlr4rust issue, the corresponding examples had been skipped.
